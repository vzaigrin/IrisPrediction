IrisPrediction
==============

This this the project for the “Developing Data Products” class from Coursera.

**IrisPrediction** is a [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com) application.

The [Iris flower data set](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set) or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by Sir Ronald Fisher (1936) as an example of discriminant analysis. It is sometimes called Anderson's Iris data set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species. Two of the three species were collected in the Gaspé Peninsula "all from the same pasture, and picked on the same day and measured at the same time by the same person with the same apparatus".

The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimetres. Based on the combination of these four features, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other.

**IrisPrediction** uses [Random forest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest) method for classification specie of Iris by its features.
