IrisPrediction
==============

This this the project for the “Developing Data Products” class from Coursera.

**IrisPrediction** is a [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com) application.

The [Iris flower data set](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set), which dates back to seminal work by the eminent statistician R. A. Fisher in the mid-1930s and is arguably the most famous dataset used in data mining, contains 50 examples of each of three types of plant: *Iris setosa*, *Iris versicolor*, and *Iris virginica*. There are four attributes: *sepal length*, *sepal width*, *petal length*, and *petal width* (all measured in centimeters).

**IrisPrediction** uses [Random forest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest) method for classification specie of Iris by its features.

Random forests is an ensemble-based method focus only on ensembles of decision trees. This method was championed by Leo Breiman and Adele Cutler, and combines the base principles of bagging with random feature selection to add additional diversity to the decision tree models. After the ensemble of trees (the forest) is generated, the model uses a vote to combine the trees predictions.
