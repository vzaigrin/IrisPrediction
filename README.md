IrisPrediction
==============

This this the project for the “Developing Data Products” class from Coursera.

**IrisPrediction** is a [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com) application.

The [Iris flower data set](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set), which dates back to seminal work by the eminent statistician R. A. Fisher in the mid-1930s and is arguably the most famous dataset used in data mining, contains 50 examples of each of three types of plant: *Iris setosa*, *Iris versicolor*, and *Iris virginica*. There are four attributes: *sepal length*, *sepal width*, *petal length*, and *petal width* (all measured in centimeters).

**IrisPrediction** uses [Random forest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest) method for classification specie of Iris by its features.
